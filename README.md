# UFO_2018

UFO reports the unidentified flying objects. We used the UFO 2018 data of United States.
Analyzed how different factors such as alien data and military data influence the UFO sightings count.
We connected MongoDB with Python in this work. For data visualization we used D3.js and Leaflet.js.
We used flask to create APIâ€™s and act as a web server.
